Field Agent Tracker

Introduction:

Optimize the routes and mode of travel for employees for reducing delays in reaching our customers
Reaching the customersâ€™ location in the most efficient and effective way, thus reducing the costs.
Live Tracking and Offer real time updates using geolocation functionality for the Field Agents and Employees on their routes

Ideaology:

We plan to use Google Maps API to track the real-time location of the salesmen/ agent and assign him the nearest location of the customer to discuss business.
The company admin will provide the location of the customer to the agent, which we plan to use forms to get the inputs and mongo DB to store it into the database.
The deadline for the field agent, the time spent by the field agent on the particular day and at each location will be the factors in deciding the number of deliveries being done.

node JS, mongodb atlas should be installed.
